Hi! My name is Timon, I'm currently studying Computer Science at Rotterdam University. Aside from that I'm working as a front-end developer at Shareworks for [Projectcampus](http://about.projectcamp.us/). I also have my own company, [Devbit](http://devbit.nl/).

My skills are mainly focused on webdevelopment. I've got experience with HTML5, CSS3 (including Less and Sass), JavaScript, AngularJS, Gulp and Webpack.
